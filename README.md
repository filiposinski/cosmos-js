# THREE.JS TESTING  

I made this repository to test the **three.js library**. 


=======
For now there is nothing more than a basic cube. 💁‍♂️

Source code based on [documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYa0aJ9xd_U) of **Hello Roman**. Thanks man! 🍻
